-- Window, Door, and Sensor HVAC Control (WDSC HVAC) plugin v1.2
-- Code originally by mcvflorin and posted to
-- http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,4327.45.html
-- Packaged in plugin form by SOlivas, with modifications 
--
-- History:
-- 1.0 - Initial version released. 
--       mcvflorin's code with modifications to turn thermostats to specified modes (On or Off) during check if
--       door or window sensor is tripped.  Currently does not support internal motion sensors in this 
--       version.  May be added in a future release.
-- 1.1 - Implemented urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1 to make it easy to trigger scenes when OnMode and 
--       OffMode fire.  Also added icon in .json file.
-- 1.2 - Implemented temperature sensor support.  By defining temperature sensors, a high and low
--       limit and an action to do if each it reached or exceeded, you can control your HVAC system
--       based on climate conditions.  Direct Twilio Plugin support has been removed.
--		 Also standardized the values used to control the settings across all modes.
--
--
-- While I do not claim copyright for this plugin, I do feel that the following from the BSD license
-- is appropriate, since this is controlling your thermostat connected to your HVAC equipment and there 
-- is always possibility for things to not work in the way in which they were intended.

-- ** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!  IF YOUR HVAC EQUIPMENT MELTS DOWN, BREAKS, OR CATCHES FIRE/EXPLODES 
-- ** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
